# downjack

A simple ~down jacket~ developer helper tool.

It can set up `.gitignore` and licenses in your projects.

## Quick Start

For example, you want to set up `.gitignore` for a Go project:

```bash
downjack gitignore go
# OR simply
downjack g go
```

then license file using `MIT`:

```bash
downjack license mit
# OR simply
downjack l mit
```

and that's it!

## Tips

It can be useful to add an alias to `dj` (pun intended ðŸ“€ðŸ¤˜)

```bash
alias dj='downjack'
```
